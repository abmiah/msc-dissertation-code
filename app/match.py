""" 
The `app/match.py` module provides functionality for matching content items with news articles based on their textual similarity. 
It begins by importing the necessary libraries and the data models used in the application.

The module defines functions to extract keywords from text, calculate similarity scores, and match content items with news 
articles from various sources. The matching process involves querying news APIs using the keywords extracted from the content 
items and comparing the text of these items with the titles and descriptions of the fetched news articles. If the similarity 
score exceeds a defined threshold, a match is recorded.

Additionally, the script imports the `SequenceMatcher` class from the `difflib` module to compute similarity ratios between 
strings, as well as the `List` type from the `typing` module for type hinting.

The `match_items_with_news` function is designed to match a list of `ContentItem` objects with news articles gathered
from a specified fetcher function. It iterates through each content item, extracts keywords to formulate a search query,
and retrieves news articles related to that query. The function then compares the text of each content item with the
titles and descriptions of the retrieved news articles, calculating a similarity score for each comparison. If the similarity 
score exceeds a predefined threshold, a `MatchResult` object is created and added to a results list. Ultimately, the function 
returns a list of `MatchResult` objects that represent the successful matches.
